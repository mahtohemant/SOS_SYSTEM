# HEMANT PROJECT V.A.J.R

## Introduction
This project, named V.A.J.R (Voltage-Activated Justice Responder), is aimed at developing a hardware safety device for women. Leveraging my expertise in C and C++, along with my experience with the A9G module and Arduino Uno, this project demonstrates my proficiency in software development for embedded systems.

## Features
- **SMS Functionality**: Utilizing the A9G module, the device can send SMS messages to predefined contacts.
- **Call Functionality**: The device can also make phone calls to specified numbers.
- **Incoming Call Detection**: The system is equipped to detect incoming calls and can be programmed to take appropriate actions.

## Setup
To run the code, the following components are required:
- Arduino Uno
- A9G module
- SoftwareSerial library

## Usage
1. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
2. Connect the A9G module to the Arduino Uno as per the specified pin configuration.
3. Power on the device and observe the serial monitor for status updates.

## Acknowledgements
This project was made possible by the valuable resources and knowledge gained through learning and working with C, C++, and embedded systems.
